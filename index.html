# sumeet

### important
- CV
  - software engineering experience
    - selected freelance projects (i worked on more, but... these are some)
    - companies
- diary of projects (youtubish thumbnails)
  <!-- TODO: Strike here next

  Flesh out each "definitely making the list" bullet point. Decide good way to present each item, and think about maybe thumbnail. Goal is to make it easy to understand what the project is, quickly. Not too much ceremony, not too words, explanation. 2 seconds you should be able to figure out what it is

  Should there be like a 1 minute video on each project? How to explain projects quickly. Pictures and GIFs might work too. A little bit of text.
