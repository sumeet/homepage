## software eng & computer science tutoring

## projects

## professional work experience

### important
- CV
  - software engineering experience
    - selected freelance projects -- between 2018 and 2023, i worked with several businesses as a contractor. these are a few of the contracts i'm allowed to talk about
      1. property guard
      1. seedtime -- rescued the project 1 week before their kickstarter launched. had bad bugs and performance issues
      1. online logo maker

    - full time work will just be regular resume stuff copied from the old resume
- diary of projects (youtubish thumbnails)
  <!-- TODO:

  Flesh out each "definitely making the list" bullet point. Decide good way to present each item, and think about maybe thumbnail. Goal is to make it easy to understand what the project is, quickly. Not too much ceremony, not too words, explanation. 2 seconds you should be able to figure out what it is

  Should there be like a 1 minute video on each project? How to explain projects quickly. Pictures and GIFs might work too. A little bit of text.

  -->
